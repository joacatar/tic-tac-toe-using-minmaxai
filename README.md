# Tic Tac Toe Showdown ðŸŽ®

Welcome to Tic Tac Toe Showdown, the ultimate battle of wits! In this classic game of Tic Tac Toe, you have the chance to challenge our AI opponents and prove your strategic prowess. Will you choose to take on the traditional Minimax AI, or do you dare to face the cunning Minimax AI with Alpha-Beta pruning? The choice is yours, and the game is on!

## How to Play
1. Launch the game, and you'll be greeted with a warm welcome and an invitation to face the AI challengers.
2. The game allows you to play as 'X,' while the AI plays as 'O.' Your goal is to achieve victory by forming a row, column, or diagonal of three 'X' marks before the AI does.
3. Make your moves wisely by entering a number from 0 to 8 to place your 'X' on the board. The AI will then respond with its strategic move.
4. The game continues until one player emerges as the winner, or the board is filled. The player who achieves victory will be celebrated with fun emojis and messages!

## Get Ready to Challenge the AI
Prepare for an exciting showdown against AI opponents that will test your decision-making skills and strategy. Will you emerge victorious, or will the AI prove its mettle? It's time to find out! Have fun, and may the best strategist win! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¥
